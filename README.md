# Fuse3DPrints
A Python script to print one gcode on top of another with or without z offset and Filament change. ONLY TESTED FOR CURA.

IT IS ADVISED TO LOOK AT THE PRODUCED GCODE AFTER THE FIRST APPLICATION TO SPOT ANY MISTAKES THE SOFTWARE MADE.
The script removes part of the gcode(like auto homeing for the second file or the purge line for any file but the first one) 
Additionaly the script adds, if wished a z-offset to any file but the first one
